# Stocks Analysis with VBA

## Project Overview
For this assignment, I harnessed the coding language of Excel, Visual Basic Application, to analyze an alternative energy stock called DQ (DAQO New Energy Corporation). The client is only interested in investing in green energy stocks and is particularily interested in DQ, however, one must diversify their portfolio in order to make safe investments. So, I also analyzed the performance of 13 other green energy stocks for the years 2017 and 2018. The goal was to see how each stock performed over a one year period and determine which ones would be the wisest investments for portfolio diversification.

## Coding Techniques
Steve wants to find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. In order to calculate these values, I used:

Loops
Conditional Statements
Code Patterns
Logical operators, also called Boolean operators
Linking condition statements together
Creating a button to run the analysis
Learn debugging and internet troubleshootingcreating

## Conclusion
After refactoring my initial code to see how all 14 stocks performed, I noticed that 2017 was a really good year for stock growth, except for TERP stocks. When looking at 2018, however, the majority of the stocks underperformed. ENPH and RUN were the only two stocks that showed positive growth that year. So, based on this available data and analysis, I woudld suggest an investor to invest in ENPH and RUN, as well as their DQ stocks.
